# PixelForge
This project is a simple image processing program that accepts an image as input and performs multiple operations on it. The program identifies the dominant colour present in the image by analysing the intensity of red, green, and blue (RGB) components. It then converts the original image into a grayscale image and counts the number of black and white pixels present in the grayscale output.

The project demonstrates basic concepts of digital image processing such as pixel manipulation, RGB colour analysis, grayscale conversion, and binary pixel classification.

#Features of this project:
1. Accepts an image file from the user.

2. Enhances image resolution using BICUBIC interpolation.

3. Detects the dominant colour (Red / Green / Blue)

4. Converts the image to grayscale.

5. Counts the number of black and white pixels in the grayscale image.

6. The code is made for beginners to understand easily.
